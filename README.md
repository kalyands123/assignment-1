sub questions

1.Why did you choose the particular algorithm?
The reason that i choose the random forest classifier is 
Robustness: Random Forest is a robust algorithm that handles both numerical and categorical data well
Performance: It generally performs well with minimal hyperparameter tuning and can manage large datasets efficiently
also handling the missing Data

2. What are the different tuning methods used for the algorithm?
The turning methods used
cross-validation Using k-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of different parameter sets and avoid overfitting
random search: Randomly sampling parameters from a specified distribution to find a good combination more efficiently

3.Did you consider any other choice of algorithm? Why or why not?
yes i considered  
Logistic Regression: Simple and interpretable, but might not capture complex relationships 
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Effective for high-dimensional spaces but can be computationally intensive for large datasets
Neural network:more complex pattern and are more computationally expensive.

4.What is the accuracy?
i got the accuracy of 0.97

5.What are the different types of metrics that can be used to evaluate the model?
various metrics can be used to evaluate the performance 
Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among positive predictions
F1-Score: The mean value providing the balance 
Confusion Matrix: A table showing the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives
